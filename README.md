Project Milestone 3 - Portfolio Interactivity with JavaScript

I added JavaScript form validation to my Contact page.
The feature checks that all fields (name, email, and message) are filled before submitting.
If any field is empty, it shows an alert asking the user to complete the form.
If everything is filled, it displays a thank-you message.
I used variables, conditionals, a function, and an event listener for this feature.
I plan to improve it later by adding dark mode.
